# Real-Time-Network-Anomaly-Detection
Designed and implemented a robust real-time intrusion detection system using Scapy, Isolation Forest, and Python. The system efficiently captures and analyzes live network traffic, extracting flow-based features to identify anomalous behavior. Leveraged machine learning for precise anomaly detection and incorporated Nmap for realistic attack simulations. Fine-tuned the model to ensure high detection accuracy, enhancing overall cybersecurity monitoring capabilities.
